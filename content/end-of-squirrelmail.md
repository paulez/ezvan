The webmail software [Squirrelmail](https://squirrelmail.org/) is not
maintained anymore. As such it doesn't get security updates and is so
risky to keep running. As such I decided to remove it from ezvan.fr.

I recommend to use [Roundcube](https://www.ezvan.fr/roundcube) instead,
long live Roundcube!
