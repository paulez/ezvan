# DVBSC

The DVBSC tool converts standard and
high definition streams from digital video broadcasting. It generates
.MPG, .TS and .M2TS video files. It also converts Dolby Digital+ audio
to regular Dolby Digital. Up to 4 sequences can be selected from the
input video stream.*

# DVD2MPG

DVD2MPG is a Windows XP program that
generates a MPEG2 stream from the .VOB files of a DVD. To do that, AC3
audio is decoded and recoded in MPEG audio. PCM audio can also be
converted to MPEG audio. MPEG2 video is transfered without any
modification except timing information. This must be done because
timings are not continuous inside a .VOB file or from one .VOB file to
another. This is not acceptable in a MPEG2 file.*

# DVD2ISO

It is better to use DVD+RW medias to
record movies and series broadcasted on TV with a DVD recorder. Editing
functions of this device allow to cut useless parts as well as
advertisements. When you are happy with the result and you want to keep
it, it’s time to copy the DVD+RW on a DVD+R. There are a lot of problems
with standard tools to do this. Usually those tools are not able to
determine the used size of the DVD+RW. Sometimes the DVD is shortened,
sometimes the copy is endless. It’s why I developed my own DVD ISO image
extraction tool. DVD2ISO analyses the DVD contents in order to find used
blocks. Its allows to save time and space. This tools includes an ISO
image virtual player.
