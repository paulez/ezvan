Hello.

I have a question concerning extraction of video directly from the
harddisk of a Sagem DVR 6280 that is connected directly to the PC via
USB.

- Have recorded material on the disk from TV-broadcasts, disk 92% full.  

- Removed harddisk (80 GB IDE/ATA) from Sagem DVR6280.  

- Put the harddisk inside an external USB cabinet.  

- Attached the USB-harddisk cabinet to a PC (WinVista Ultimate and WinXP
Pro, have tried both).  

- In diskmanager, harddisk is recognized as "Foreign disk".  

- Ran the utility DVBT2MPG which resulted in "No DVB-T disk found".  

- Ran the DVBTX with same result.

Seems that the utility doesn't recognize that the DVB-T harddisk is
connected to the PC via USB.  

Is there any way I can get the utility to recognize the attached DVB-T
harddisk?

Kind regards. Palethed.
